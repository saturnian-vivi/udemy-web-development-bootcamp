<h1>The Best Movies According to Vivi</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Kung Fu Panda</h3>
<p>My go-to rewatch movie for its comedy and characters. I especially love the fact that the main character is a heavy-weight panda who is the strongest as opposed to its real life nature.</p>

<h3>Cars</h3>
<p>All the characters and its message in subtle ways about the importance of friends and life lessons make it a fun yet comforting watch.</p>

<h3>Hotel Transylvania</h3>
<p>I love it for the take on its characters and how they all seem realistic in their comedic yet stereotypical personalities as humans as well as mythical creatures.</p>
